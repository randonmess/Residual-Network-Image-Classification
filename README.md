# Residual-Network-Image-Classification
Using TensorFlow/Keras, the Identity Block and Convolution Block of a Residual Network are implemented and used to make a ResNet50 model to classify the MINIST digits hand sign dataset. This model is trained on 1080 examples.

## Objectives
- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets in a deep neural network using Keras
- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification
- Implement a skip connection in your network

## Results
The model acheived a 78% accuracy score on a test set of 120.
